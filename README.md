# Skeleton-based preprocessing and augmentation technique

### Preprocessing

1. Translation removal
2. Scale normalization

### Augmentation

1. Random rotation along z-axis
2. Random rotation along neck-mid hip vector
3. View normalization (rotating the skeleton figures to unify the facing direction)
